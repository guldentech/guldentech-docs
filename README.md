## The Platform

GuldenTech is 100% ran on kubernetes. If you are not familiar with kubernetes there may be a little bit of a learning curve, but we provide an easy to navigate web console that sits on top of kubernetes to help you quickly navigate through your workloads and resources.

The platform sitting on top of kubernetes is Rancher.
