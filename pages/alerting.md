# Alerting

GuldenTech provides the ability for your website to be monitored in case of some unexpected downage. We leverage kuma-uptime to curl your website every 60 seconds to make sure it is still running. Kuma will post a alert to the GuldenTech discord alerting everyone about the issue. This can be customed to send you a notification a different way.

!> Please email [guldentechjobs@gmail.com](mailto:guldentechjobs@gmail.com) to enable alerting on your website.
